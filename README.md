### A Web App to store UFO incident data with filtering capabilities

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to expand the filtering capabilities of a previously designed web app containing UFO incident data. Previously, only the incident date could be filtered. The app has now been updated to include filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The web app allows for filtering based on the following criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape. For example, if we wished to filter the data to show only incidents for California, we would type "ca" into the "Enter State" filter box, as follows:

Additional filters can be added to the first. For example, to filter for incidents in California with the shape triangle, we would follow by typing "triangle" into the "Enter Shape" filter:

## Summary

The update allows greater filtering capabilities to the web app. A drawback is that the additional filter boxes take more screen space, making the screen appear clunkier and potentially detracting from over user enjoyment. This can be mitigated by adding the following additional functionalities:

1. Collapsing the filter boxes under a single "filter" button.The boxes would now only show up if the user decides to add filters to the raw data
2. Collapsing the data under a "data" button. The data will now only be visible if the user decides to view it, thereby streamlining the initial experience of visiting the website
